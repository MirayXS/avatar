# avatar-autosetup-demo
A Demo Experience for the new AutoSetupAvatarAsync API in AvatarCreationService.

The Workspace consists of 3 humanoid Models which each consist of a single MeshPart and SurfaceAppearance.
Clicking on any of them will invoke the In-Experience Avatar Auto-Setup function.

When it completes, the resulting avatar can be equipped by clicking on the pedestal again.

Clicking once more on the currently equipped avatar pedestal will bring up the PromptCreateAvatarAsync dialog to upload
the automatically setup avatar to the user's inventory.
